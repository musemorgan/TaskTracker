#This will serve as the main coding elements for my personal task tracker project

#Importing the FastAPI class from fastapi module, look into what module is?
from fastapi import FastAPI # similar to SQL, but not sure of significance
app = FastAPI() #defines my new app that im creating
#app is an object, it is where interaction between the client and browser take place
#fast api is a webframework, something that helps to simplify api creation [look to see if webframework is just a specialized api?]

#defining a path
@app.get("/get-message")
async def read_root():
        return {"Message" : "Congrats! This is your first API"}
#def root & return a function ? look more into this
# lines 10 is a route decorator, defines http location that will serve as the endpoint [in this case get-message]
